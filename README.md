# canvas_attendance_recorder

In order to record attendance for you class, please get the class ID and get an API key from canvas. You must create two text files 'class.txt' and 'token.txt', each containing only a single line with the class ID and API Token respectively. After this is done, you can run the program using the assignment ID for the attendance record. The attendance will be recorded as a 1 in the canvas grade book.
